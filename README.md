# Freelancer-Life-Financial-Planner

Here's a simple Streamlit app:

This app provides a comprehensive interface for users to input their financial parameters and then see a detailed breakdown of their financial situation.

The sidebar allows for easy input, and the main area displays the results in a clear and organized manner.

Streamlit is a powerful tool for building web applications with Python, and it's particularly well-suited for data-driven applications like this one . By making the values dynamic, users can adjust them based on their circumstances and preferences, allowing for a more personalized financial planning experience.

Set Up Your Environment:

Make sure you have Python installed.
Install the necessary libraries:

Create project folder 

> mkdir richlife-financial-planner

Create file 

> touch richlife_planner_app.py

Commands to run this app:

```
python -m venv myenv ~~~
source myenv/bin/activate # On Windows, use myenv\Scripts\activate pip install streamlit ~~~

pip freeze #show all libraries installed with its version number
```
To run the app, save the app code to a file, say richlife_planner_app.py, and then run:
```
streamlit run richlife_planner_app.py
```
This will launch the app in your default web browser. As you make changes to the code, Streamlit will automatically update the app in the browser.
